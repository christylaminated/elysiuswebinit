Build a premium, modern landing page for a neurotechnology startup named “Elysius Labs”.

Goal:
Create a visually striking, conversion-focused landing page for a wearable sleep system that uses real-time brainwave sensing and gentle cues to guide the brain back to restful sleep. The page MUST show BOTH products: (1) an EEG headband and (2) an eye mask. The design should feel sleek, mythic, and high-end (“neurotech meets quiet luxury”), not “biohacker gadget”.

Core message (use this language style):
- Short, confident, elegant, founder-grade.
- Avoid heavy jargon. No cringe “optimize your sleep” bro-science tone.
- Emphasize: real-time detection + intervention during sleep (closed-loop).

Tech requirements:
- Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
- Single-page landing (/, no extra routes).
- Fully responsive (mobile-first).
- Use Framer Motion for subtle section reveals and gentle floating/glow animations.
- Use lucide-react icons.
- Performance: optimized images, lazy-loading, minimal JS.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, good contrast, aria labels.

Brand & visual style:
- Palette: deep midnight/obsidian background with soft gradients (indigo/violet/pearl highlights). Keep it understated.
- Typography: modern + elegant (e.g., Inter + a classy serif for headings). Use next/font.
- Layout: lots of whitespace, smooth rounded cards, subtle borders, soft shadows.
- Add a tasteful “aura”/“halo” motif (concentric rings) behind product renders.

Page sections (must include all):
1) Top Nav
   - Left: “Elysius Labs” wordmark
   - Right: links (Technology, Products, Evidence, FAQ) + primary CTA button “Join Waitlist”

2) HERO (most important)
   - Headline options (pick best):
     A) “Fix sleep while you’re sleeping.”
     B) “Real-time neurotechnology for restorative sleep.”
     C) “When sleep goes wrong, Elysius guides it back.”
   - Subheadline: explain in 1–2 lines: monitors brainwaves in real time and delivers gentle cues (sound/light) to steer away from stress/nightmare states.
   - Two product visuals shown side-by-side or layered:
     - EEG Headband (primary)
     - Eye Mask (secondary)
   - Buttons:
     - Primary: “Join Waitlist”
     - Secondary: “See how it works”
   - Add a small trust strip under buttons with 3 items (icons + text):
     - “Real-time brainwave sensing”
     - “Closed-loop cues during sleep”
     - “Designed for clinical credibility”

3) “How it works” (simple 3-step pipeline)
   Step 1: Sense (EEG signals)
   Step 2: Detect (nightmare/stress signatures)
   Step 3: Guide (gentle cues to return to restful sleep)
   Include a simple animated diagram (horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile) using divs/SVG (no external images required).

4) Products section (MUST show BOTH clearly)
   - Two product cards:
     - “EEG Headband” with 3 bullets (Comfort-first, real-time sensing, wireless-ready)
     - “Eye Mask” with 3 bullets (Light/audio cues, comfortable fit, sleep-safe design)
   - Include “Designed as a system” note.

5) “Why Elysius Labs” (3–4 benefit cards)
   - Examples:
     - “Intervene before full awakening”
     - “Gentle, non-invasive cues”
     - “Built for high-signal environments (sleep)”
     - “A path from clinical wedge → broader sleep market”
   Keep it grounded and credible.

6) Evidence / Credibility section
   - Do NOT claim FDA approval.
   - Use cautious language: “grounded in sleep neuroscience”, “informed by peer-reviewed research”, “clinic
