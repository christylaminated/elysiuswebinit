Improve my existing Elysius Labs landing page so it is VA and clinical partner appropriate, elegant and scientific, and conceptually consistent. This is an edit, not a redesign. You must keep the current visual design, layout style, and especially the existing headband and eye mask imagery, composition, lighting, and card styling. Do not replace the product renders with generic placeholders or stock images. Keep the same aesthetic and visual hierarchy.

Hard rules
1) Mobile first, then scale to desktop
2) Fully responsive and tested at 375px, 414px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px widths
3) No consumer coded language like waitlist, subscribe, preorder, shop, buy now, early adopters
4) Do not use double hyphens anywhere in copy or code comments
5) No medical claims, no FDA approval language, no diagnosis or treatment claims
6) Every button must do something real, no dead clicks
7) Preserve existing design assets and styling
   - Keep the headband render exactly as used now
   - Keep the eye mask render exactly as used now
   - Keep their current crop, scale, aspect ratio, and placement
   - Keep the current dark gradient background and aura effects
   - Keep current fonts, spacing, and card shapes unless a change is needed purely for mobile responsiveness

Navigation updates
- Keep the same tabs: Technology, Products, Evidence, FAQ
- Replace the top right button text from Join Waitlist to Pilot Access
- Pilot Access button must scroll to a Pilot Access section near the bottom of the page

CTA behavior updates
- Primary CTA in the hero must be Pilot Access and scroll to the Pilot Access section
- Secondary CTA in the hero must be View System Overview and scroll to The Restorative Loop section
- Add microcopy under each CTA
  Under Pilot Access: For VA programs, research collaborators, and clinical partners.
  Under View System Overview: Closed-loop sensing to detection to guidance.

Hero copy updates
Replace the hero headline and subheadline with
Headline: Real-time neurotechnology for restorative sleep.
Subheadline: Elysius Labs monitors brain activity during sleep and delivers gentle, closed-loop sensory guidance to help stabilize disrupted sleep states without waking the user.

Trust strip updates
Replace trust strip items with
Real-time EEG sensing
Closed-loop intervention
Built with clinical credibility

System framing correction for Products section
The current page makes the headband and mask look like separate products. Fix the copy and section framing so it is clear they are interfaces of one closed-loop system, with configurable guidance modalities selected by patient preference and tolerance. Keep the visuals exactly the same.
- Rename the Products section header to Configurable System Interfaces
- Add a short subheader under it:
  One closed-loop neurotechnology system, delivered through patient-preferred interfaces.
- Change the two cards to reflect system roles
  Card 1 title: EEG Headband
  Card 1 subtitle: Neural Sensing Interface
  Card 1 description line: Primary signal acquisition for real-time sleep state detection.
  Card 2 title: Guidance Mask
  Card 2 subtitle: Guidance Interface Option
  Card 2 description line: A configurable modality for closed-loop sensory guidance.
- Rewrite the bullets so they are precise and credible, not marketing
  EEG Headband bullets should emphasize signal quality, low latency telemetry, overnight ergonomics
  Guidance Mask bullets should emphasize subtle sensory cues, minimal intrusion, selected by comfort and clinical context

Remove FIG labeling
If any visuals use FIG 01 or FIG 02 captions, remove them.
Use either component names only or layer names only.
Preferred captions
EEG Sensor Array
Guidance Mask

Restorative Loop copy updates
Keep the three steps Sense, Detect, Guide but rewrite to be lab like and VA credible
Sense: Clinical-grade EEG sensors capture brain activity during sleep with high temporal resolution.
Detect: The detection engine identifies markers of hyperarousal and nightmare-like disruption as they emerge.
Guide: Subtle auditory, light, or haptic cues gently guide the brain back toward stable, restorative states.

Evidence section change
Keep Evidence as a main nav tab but improve it so it contains blog style updates without calling it a blog. Keep the same Evidence section styling, spacing, and background.
Inside Evidence, create two subsections
1) Foundations
  One paragraph on scientific grounding and closed-loop rationale with cautious language
2) Research Notes
  A list of card entries that look like lab notes, not blog posts
  Each card has title, date, 2 to 3 sentence summary, and a link style button View research note that opens a modal with more text
Seed at least 3 example Research Notes with VA appropriate titles
Do not use the word blog anywhere

Pilot Access section
Create a Pilot Access section near the bottom with a short form that matches the existing design language and button styles.
Fields

Submit button text: Request pilot access
On submit show a confirmation message and store the submission locally for now
No backend required but code should be easy to connect later

Design requirements
- Maintain the current neurotech lab aesthetic already present on the page
- Do not change the headband and mask visuals, their placement, or their styling
- Keep the existing aura and lighting effects
- Use subtle motion only

Mobile layout rules
- On mobile, hero CTAs stack vertically with comfortable spacing and full width buttons
- Microcopy must not wrap awkwardly or collide with buttons
- Trust strip collapses into a vertical list or horizontal scroll row
- Product cards stack in one column and images do not crop important areas
- Ensure accessibility: large tap targets, focus states, aria labels

Deliverable
Return updated code that implements all copy changes, fixes the system framing, replaces waitlist language, removes FIG labels, adds Evidence subsections with Research Notes modal, adds a functional Pilot Access section, and ensures mobile friendly layout while preserving the current headband and eye mask design exactly.
